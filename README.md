#  RAG-Based Customer Support Assistant

An AI-powered Customer Support Assistant built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **LangGraph workflow orchestration** and **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** support.

---

##  Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent customer support system that:
- Processes a PDF knowledge base
- Retrieves relevant information using vector embeddings
- Generates context-aware responses using an LLM
- Uses a graph-based workflow for decision-making
- Escalates queries to humans when confidence is low

##  Key Features

🔹 PDF Document Processing  
🔹 Intelligent Text Chunking  
🔹 Semantic Embeddings Generation  
🔹 Vector Database (ChromaDB)  
🔹 Context-Aware Answer Generation (LLM)  
🔹 LangGraph Workflow Execution  
🔹 Conditional Routing Logic  
🔹 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Escalation

##  System Architecture

The system consists of two main pipelines:

###  Document Ingestion Pipeline
- Load PDF  
- Chunk text  
- Generate embeddings  
- Store in ChromaDB  

###  Query Processing Pipeline
- Accept user query  
- Retrieve relevant chunks  
- Generate response using LLM  
- Apply decision logic  
- Return answer or escalate
